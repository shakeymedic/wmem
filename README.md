## How to Create Screenshots

### Method 1: Take Screenshots from Your Browser

1. Open each tool in your browser
2. Press F11 for fullscreen (or use your browser's fullscreen mode)
3. Take a screenshot:
   - **Windows**: Windows Key + Shift + S
   - **Mac**: Cmd + Shift + 4
4. Save the screenshot with the correct filename (see list above)
5. Place it in this `screenshots` folder

### Method 2: Use Browser Extensions

Install a screenshot extension like:
- **Full Page Screen Capture** (Chrome/Edge)
- **Awesome Screenshot** (Firefox/Chrome)

### Method 3: Use Online Tools

1. Go to https://www.screenshotmachine.com/
2. Enter your tool URL
3. Download the screenshot
4. Rename and save to this folder

## Recommended Screenshot Settings

- **Size**: 1200px wide × 800px tall (will be cropped to fit)
- **Format**: PNG or JPG
- **Quality**: High quality for clear display
- **Content**: Show the main interface of each tool

## What Happens Without Screenshots?

If a screenshot is missing, the card will display:
- A gradient background with your WMEBEM blue colours
- The tool's icon in the centre
- Still looks professional, just not as informative

## Tips for Good Screenshots

✅ **Do:**
- Capture the tool at desktop resolution (not mobile)
- Show the main screen/interface
- Make sure no patient data is visible
- Use a clean, uncluttered view

❌ **Don't:**
- Include browser chrome (address bar, bookmarks, etc.)
- Show any real patient information
- Use low-resolution images
- Include your desktop background

## Quick Batch Process

If you want to do them all at once:

1. Open each tool in a separate browser tab
2. Use a browser extension to capture all tabs
3. Rename files according to the list above
4. Move all files to this folder
5. Redeploy your site to Netlify

That's it! Your tool cards will now show beautiful screenshots.

**Note:** The website will work perfectly even without screenshots - they just enhance the visual appeal and help users recognize the tools quickly.
